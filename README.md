# Peptides SpecTra Annotations (PaSTA)

## Background
Unlike the genomics field, currently most tools/workflows for analyzing proteomics data are either tied to a specific platform, such as Galaxy, or an operating system (OS), such as Microsoft 
Windows or Linux.  This lack of publicly available, non-platform/OS-dependent and reusable proteomics tools and workflows is preventing valuable public proteomic datasets, such as those in 
NCIâ€™s [Proteomic Data Commons](), to be analyzed.  This proposal is to create an analysis workflow to generate annotated peptide sequence from proteomic spectra using containerized tools.
